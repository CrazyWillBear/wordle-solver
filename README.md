## Why?
I've been told that this "ruins the spirit of the game", however I completely disagree. If the goal of the game is to use logic and brainpower to guess the word, creating algorithms from scratch and creating a technological solution qualifies.

## To Run:
- Compile (duh)
- Make sure that `resources/words.txt` is located in the same directory as the binary/where you're running the program

## Warnings
Although I know Java as a language, this is my first time actually using it to code something. Please be forgiving if there are blaitant errors or things missing that are traditionally there.
